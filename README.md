## About engagement insights

[Getting Started with Engagement Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/engagement-insights/get-started)

Engagement insights enables you to understand interactively, how your customers are using your services and products on websites, mobile apps, and connected products. Combine behavioral analytics with transactional, demographic, survey, and other data types from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. 

Using the engagement insights iOS framework on your mobile app generates “View” and “Action” events, which power engagement insights out-of-the-box mobile analytics reports to see who’s using your mobile app and what they’re doing. 

Log custom events and build your own reports for richer insights on how your mobile app is being used.
