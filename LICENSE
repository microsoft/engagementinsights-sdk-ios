________________________________________
These software license terms are an agreement (“Agreement”) between you (“Licensee”) and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates) related to the software identified above, as well as any updates Microsoft may provide (the “Software”).  The Software is designed to work with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, and to the extent you use the software with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights or any other Microsoft service, the applicable terms between you and Microsoft for that service will govern in case such terms conflict with this Agreement.  IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.  Subject to other restrictions herein, Licensee may: (a) install and use the Software on multiple Licensee computers to use in connection with Licensee’s products and services; and (b) reasonably copy the Software, and include applicable parts of the Software in Licensee’s programs, in each case solely in accordance with and for the purpose in the above clause 1(a) (and any part of the Software merged with another program will continue to be subject to this Agreement).
2.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
    a)	copy, modify, transfer, or distribute the Software, or any part of it, except as may expressly be permitted under this Agreement; 
    b)	make any derivative works of the Software; however, this may not be construed to preclude Licensee from: 
        i)	incorporating applicable binary portions of the Software into Licensee’s programs, solely as contemplated by the documentation); or
        ii)	creating custom events during Licensee’s use of the Software;
    c)	work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
    d)	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
    e)	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
    f)	use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
    g)	share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
3.	NO SUPPORT. Microsoft is not obligated to support the Software. If Microsoft elects to provide any support, it may stop (or change how it is) doing so at any time, for any or no reason, without notice.
4.	NO WARRANTIES. The Software is licensed “as-is.” Licensee bears all risk of using it. Microsoft gives no warranties or guarantees (express, implied, or otherwise) regarding the Software or any related products, services, or technologies. Licensee may have additional rights under Licensee’s local laws that this Agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under Licensee’s local laws, Microsoft excludes all implied warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Without limiting the above, Microsoft does not warrant that the Software will meet Licensee’s requirements or that operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software is with you.
5.	LIMITED REMEDIES. Licensee can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $1. Licensee cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, indirect, special, punitive, or incidental damages. Licensee also cannot recover for any loss of data, confidentiality, privacy, or profits; or any inability to use the Software. This limitation applies to anything related to the Software, including to claims for breach of contract; breach of warranty, guarantee, or condition; or strict liability, negligence, or other tort, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to Licensee because Licensee’s state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
6.	FEEDBACK.  Licensee is not required to provide feedback.  However, all suggestions, comments, and feedback given by Licensee to Microsoft regarding the Software (“Feedback”) is and will be given entirely voluntarily, and Microsoft and its Affiliates will, on a non-exclusive basis, be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
7.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the Software.
8.	INDEMNIFICATION. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold Microsoft, its affiliates, and their respective successors, directors, officers, employees, and agents harmless from and against all third-party claims, actions, demands, proceedings, damages, costs, and liabilities of any kind arising out of or related to Licensee’s exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement.
9.	CONFIDENTIALITY. The Software shall be considered Confidential Information under the parties’ existing Non-Disclosure Agreement. If no such non-disclosure agreement exists, the following terms apply: 
    (a)	“Confidential Information” means nonpublic information that (i) Microsoft or Licensee designates as confidential; or (ii) which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential. “Confidential Information” does not include information that:  (x) is or subsequently becomes generally available without breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; (y) is or subsequently becomes known to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party and such disclosure does not result from any breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed with respect to such Confidential Information; or (z) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to any Confidential Information supplied by the disclosing party in any form.
    (b)	Each party shall protect the Confidential Information of the other party from unauthorized disclosure or dissemination and use no less than that degree of care it uses to protect its own like information, which shall not be less than a reasonable degree of care.  Neither party shall use the Confidential Information of the other party for purposes other than those necessary to directly further the purposes of this Agreement.  Neither party shall disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to third parties without the prior written consent of the other party.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no ownership or license rights are granted in any Confidential Information.
10.	SURVIVAL. Sections 2-6 shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement.
11.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.
12.	ADDITIONAL TERMS. 
    a)	Licensee may not assign this Agreement, or any rights or duties under it, directly or indirectly (e.g., by merger, consolidation, reorganization, or transfer of control), by operation of contract, law, or otherwise, except with Microsoft’s express written consent.
    b)	If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any term of this Agreement unenforceable, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent possible to effect the parties’ intent, and all other terms will continue in force. Captions are intended solely for the parties’ convenience and do not affect the meaning of any term.
    c)	The Agreement is governed by Washington law, disregarding conflict of law rules. Licensee consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in King County, Washington and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens in these courts. In any action or suit to enforce or interpret this Agreement, Microsoft is entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Notwithstanding the above, Microsoft may seek to enjoin intellectual property infringement or misappropriation in any jurisdiction.
    d)	No waiver of any breach of this Agreement will waive any other breach, and only written waivers are effective.
    e)	This Agreement will be interpreted according its plain meaning without presuming it should favor either party. This Agreement has been executed in English, which is the sole language used to interpret and construe its meaning (except if otherwise required by applicable law).
